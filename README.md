## Project Structure    
### a. Overview
This web application is structured into 8 main parts, i.e. user signing up for an account, logging in/out of an account, updating their user profile, browsing through the catalogues of books offered by the bookstore, add their favourite books to the shopping cart, update / delete their shopping cart items, checkout their shopping cart items as well as browse through their previous orders history.

At the landing page, users will find a navbar at the uppermost part of the web application. This navbar will show links to different pages of the web application depending on whether a user is currently logged in or not. The 2 scenarios will be as follow:
1. User not logged in: the navbar will display link to Explore More Books, Register and also Login. 
2. User logged in: the navbar will display link to Explore More Books, Profile, View Purchase, View Cart and also Logout.

At the main section of the landing page, users (both logged in as well as without logging in) will find a banner that display a short message informing the user that free shipping is applied for orders above $100 dollars and a Shop Now button below it. Further down, users will find three carousel sliders each displaying bestsellers book, new & trending book as well as books under $5.00. Clicking on the books displayed on the carousel sliders will redirect the user to a show books detail page whereby user will be able to check out all the relevant information related to the particular book and also to add the item to the cart if they are currently logged in. At the very bottom of the page, user will be able to find a footer section that contains information about the bookstore itself, the customer services it provides, the get in touch with us, the find us on links as well as a form that allows user to subscribe to the bookstore's newsletter. 

Clicking on the Explore More Books tab on the navbar will redirect users to a page whereby they will be able to browse through all the books that are currently available in the bookstore. On the left side of the same page, users will be able to use the filter by function that allows user to filter out books by a particular genre, author or price range. The query to fetch the results based on the filter option selected by the user will be done via AJAX and the results returned will be displayed using Django Digg-style pagination. To check out more on the books itself, the user will just have to click on the books of their choices and they will be redirected to the show books detail page.

Clicking on the Profile tab will redirect the users to the update user profile page. At this page, user will be able to see their firstname, lastname, username as well as email address. To update their user profile, they would just have to fill out the update user profile form and click on the update button.

Clicking on the View Purchase tab will redirect the users to a page whereby they will be able to view their previous purchases and also to check on the status of their orders. If the user logged in is a superuser, they will then be able to change the order status of a particular order.

Clicking on the View Cart tab will redirect the users to their shopping cart page whereby they will be able to see a breakdown of the items that are currently in their shopping cart. On the same page, users will be able delete a shopping cart item and also to update the quantity of books that they would like to order via jQuery event handler. To checkout the items in the shopping cart, users will just need to click on the proceed to checkout button on the bottom right which then will redirect the user to a confirm checkout page that shows user a summary of their orders and the amount that they would have to pay for. Clicking on the Place Order button will then route the user to the checkout page whereby the user will need to provide their personal details as well as their credit card details in order to make the purchase.

Clicking on the Logout button will log the user out from the web application. 

Clicking on the Register button will redirect user to the user registration page whereby user will be able to sign up for an account.

Clicking on the Login button will redirect user to the login page whereby they will need to sign in to their account using the username and email address that they have  registered for during the account registration process.

## Project Surface
Design Choices:
1. Carousel sliders are used to display books on the landing page to improve user experience when browsing through books collection.
2. AJAX jQuery was used to retrieve books collection based on the filter option selected by the user. It was used as it improves user experience by not reloading the current page the user is on just to populate that page with new information retrieved back from the database.
3. Tables were used to summarized the orders summary and purchase made so that information can be displayed in an organized format.
4. Unkempt, a funky and stylish fonts was used to display texts used in this web application.

## Bugs and Limitations Discovered
jQuery was used to update the total amount and the stock available of a particular book when the order quantity is changed in the shopping cart page. 
The total amount and stock available of a particular book update accordingly when the order quantity is changed on a large screen device.
However, when this was tested out on a mobile device, the total amount and stock available does not seem to update accordingly.
Snapshot of limitations discovered:
- Laptop have the correct total amount and stock available updated (left picture)
- Mobile device does not have the correct total amount and stock available updated (right picture)

3. Install the following dependencies that is needed to make the project to work on Heroku
   ```
       sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev
       sudo pip3 install gunicorn
       sudo pip3 install psycopg2
       sudo pip3 install Pillow
       sudo pip3 install whitenoise 
       sudo pip3 install dj_database_url
   ```
4. In the settings.py file, add WhiteNoise to the middleware:
    ```
        MIDDLEWARE = [
        .....
        'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware'
        ]
   ```

5. Create a repository for the project. To initialize a new repository, run the following command in your terminal:
    a. git init
    b. git add .
    c. git commit -m "First Commit"
6. Create a .gitignore file and add the files that are to be ignored that is taken from [here](http://gitignore.io/api/django). Also, add the .c9 file to the end of the .gitignore file
7. Create a repository in Github
8. To link your git repository with the remote repository in Github, run the following command:
   ```git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>```
9.  Login to Heroku by running this command: ```heroku login -i```
10. Create a new app in Heroku by running this command: ```heroku create <APP NAME> ```. Replace the <APP NAME> with a name of your choice and note that the Heroku app name chosen needs to be unique 
11. Double check the Heroku app was successfully created by running this command: ```git remote -v```
12. In Heroku, go to the settings tab and click on the 'Reveal Config Vars' button. Copy the environment variables from the .bashrc file in AWS Cloud 9 over
    ![Environment variables settings](https://i.imgur.com/jlkidiR.png)
13. At the root folder, create a filename called Procfile. Add this line ```web: gunicorn <PROJECT_FOLDER>.wsgi:application``` inside the Procfile and replace the <PROJECT_FOLDER> with your project's name
14. Inside the settings.py file, add the domain name of the heroku app under the ALLOWED_HOST section
15. Generate a requirements.txt file with ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
16. Add STATIC_ROOT in settings.py file in order for WhiteNoise to work properly. The line of code to be added would be ```STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')```
17. Commit all files to the git repository before deploying to Heroku. To deploy, run the following command:
    a. git add.
    b. git commit -m "deploy to Heroku"
    c. git push heroku master
18. To open the Heroku app, go to the very top of the page and click on "Open App".

### c. Setting up PostgreSQL Database
PostgreSQL will be used as the database to store all the datatables and datasets for this project. To setup the Postgres Database, the following steps that was shared to us by our instructor, Mr Paul, was followed:
1. Create a Postgres database in Heroku by running this command: ```heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql```
2. Run this command ```heroku config``` to check the URL of the database that has just been created at Step 1
3. In the .bashrc file, add this line of code ```export DATABASE_URL="database_url"```. The database_url is obtained from Step 2. Restart the bash terminal once the .bashrc file has been saved.
4. In the settings.py file, import dj_database_url package
5. In the settings.py file, go to the DATABASES section. Comment out the lines of code that uses sqlite3 as the database and add in this line of code ```DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"])}```
6. Save the settings.py file and restart the terminal. After that, do a migration by running this command: ```python3 manage.py migrate```
7. Commit all files and do a git push to Heroku by running this few lines of code:
    ```
        git add .
        git commit -m "Updated settings.py"
        git push heroku master
    ```
8. Create a superuser with this command ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```. Once the superuser account is created, the superuser will be able to access Django admin and add in models.
